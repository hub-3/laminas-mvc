# Introduction

laminas-mvc is the MVC layer shipped with Laminas and above, and focuses
on performance and flexibility.

The MVC layer is built on top of the following components:

- laminas-servicemanager - laminas-mvc provides a set of default service definitions,
  used to create and configure the application instance and workflow.
- laminas-eventmanager - The MVC is event driven, and uses events for the initial
  bootstrapping of the application, for returning response and request calls,
  for matching routes, and even for rendering views.
- laminas-http - specifically the request and response objects from the
  `Laminas\Http\PhpEnvironment` namespace, which provide objects that ensure the
  request is injected with the current environment (including query parameters,
  POST parameters, HTTP headers, etc.), and that the response will interact
  correctly with the SAPI and output buffering.
- laminas-stdlib - specifically `Laminas\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface`. All
  "controllers" are simply dispatchable objects.
- laminas-router - provides routing of a request. In other
  words, it matches the request to its respective controller (or dispatchable).

Within the MVC layer, several sub-components are exposed:

- `Laminas\Mvc\Controller`, a set of abstract "controller" classes with basic
  responsibilities such as event wiring, action dispatching, etc., as well as
  controller plugins.
- `Laminas\Mvc\Service` provides a set of laminas-servicemanager factories and
  definitions for the default application workflow.
- `Laminas\Mvc\View` provides default wiring for renderer selection, view script
  resolution, helper registration, and more; additionally, it provides a
  number of listeners that tie into the MVC workflow, providing features such
  as automated template name resolution, automated view model creation and
  injection, etc.

The gateway to the MVC is the [Laminas\\Mvc\\Application](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-mvc/blob/master/src/Application.php)
object (referred to as `Application` henceforth). Its primary responsibilities
are to **bootstrap** resources, to **route** the request, and to retrieve and
**dispatch** the controller matched during routing. Once accomplished, it will
**render** the view, and **finish** the request, returning and sending the
response.

## Basic Application Structure

The basic application structure follows:

```bash
application_root/
    config/
        application.config.php
        autoload/
            global.php
            local.php
            // etc.
    data/
    module/
    vendor/
    public/
        .htaccess
        index.php
```

The `public/index.php` script marshals all user requests to your website,
retrieving an array of configuration from `config/application.config.php`. On
return, it `run()`s the `Application`, processing the request and returning a
response to the user.

The `config` directory as described above contains configuration used by
laminas-modulemanager to load modules and merge configuration (e.g., database
configuration and credentials); we will detail this more later.

The `vendor` sub-directory should contain any third-party modules or libraries
on which your application depends. This might include Laminas, custom
libraries from your organization, or other third-party libraries from other
projects. Libraries and modules placed in the `vendor` sub-directory should not
be modified from their original, distributed state.  Typically, this directory
will be managed by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Finally, the `module` directory will contain one or more modules delivering your
application's functionality.

Let's now turn to modules, as they are the basic units of a web application.

## Basic Module Structure

A module may contain anything: PHP code, including MVC functionality; library
code; view scripts; and/or public assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
The only requirement &mdash; and even this is optional &mdash; is that a module
acts as a PHP namespace and that it contains a `Module` class under that
namespace.  This class is eventually consumed by laminas-modulemanager to perform a
number of tasks.

The recommended module structure follows:

```bash
module_root<named-after-module-namespace>/
    Module.php
    autoload_classmap.php
    autoload_function.php
    autoload_register.php
    config/
        module.config.php
    public/
        images/
        css/
        js/
    src/
        <module_namespace>/
            <code files>
    test/
        phpunit.xml
        bootstrap.php
        <module_namespace>/
            <test code files>
    view/
        <dir-named-after-module-namespace>/
            <dir-named-after-a-controller>/
                <.phtml files>
```

Since a module acts as a namespace, the module root directory should be that
namespace. This namespace could also include a vendor prefix of sorts. As an
example a module centered around "User" functionality delivered by Laminas might be
named "LaminasUser", and this is also what the module root directory will be named.

> ### Source and test code organization
>
> The above details a [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) structure for
> the source and test code directories. You can also use
> [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) so long as you have setup
> autoloading correctly to do so.

The `Module.php` file directly under the module root directory will be in the
module namespace shown below.

```php
namespace LaminasUser;

class Module
{
}
```

> ### Module class location
>
> If you have an autoloader defined, such as detailed later around the various
> `autoload_*.php` files or using Composer's [autoloading features](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading),
> then your `Module.php` file can be co-located with your source code.
>
> Our current recommendation is to define autoloading for your
> application-specific modules via Composer.

When an `init()` method is defined, this method will be triggered by a
laminas-modulemanager listener when it loads the module class, and passed a
`ModuleManager` instance by default. This allows you to perform tasks such as
setting up module-specific event listeners. But be cautious, the `init()` method
is called for **every** module on **every** page request and should **only** be
used for performing **lightweight** tasks such as registering event listeners.
Similarly, an `onBootstrap()` method (which accepts an `MvcEvent` instance) may
be defined; it is also triggered for every page request, and should be used for
lightweight tasks as well.

The three `autoload_*.php` files are not required, but recommended if you are
not using Composer to provide autoloading for your module. They provide the
following:

 File                    | Description
-------------------------|------------
 `autoload_classmap.php` | Should return an array classmap of class name/filename pairs (with the filenames resolved via the `__DIR__` magic constant).
 `autoload_function.php` | Should return a PHP callback that can be passed to `spl_autoload_register()`. Typically, this callback should utilize the map returned by `autoload_classmap.php.`
 `autoload_register.php` | should register a PHP callback (is typically returned by `autoload_function.php` with `spl_autoload_register()`.

The point of these three files is to provide reasonable default mechanisms for autoloading the
classes contained in the module, thus providing a trivial way to consume the module without
requiring laminas-modulemanager (e.g., for use outside a Laminas application).

The `config` directory should contain any module-specific configuration. These
files may be in any format laminas-config supports. We recommend naming the main
configuration `module.config.<format>` (e.g., for PHP-based configuration,
`module.config.php`). Typically, you will create configuration for the router as
well as for the service manager.

The `src` directory should be a [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) or
[PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compliant directory structure with
your module's source code.

The `test` directory should contain your unit tests. Typically, these are written using
[PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de).

The `public` directory can be used for assets that you may want to expose in
your application's document root. These might include images, CSS files,
JavaScript files, etc. How these are exposed is left to the developer.

The `view` directory contains view scripts related to your controllers.

## Bootstrapping an Application

The `Application` has seven basic dependencies.

- **configuration**, usually an array or object implementing `Traversable`.
- **ServiceManager** instance.
- **EventManager** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the
  `ServiceManager`, by the service name "EventManager".
- **SharedEventManager** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the
  `ServiceManager`, by the service name "SharedEventManager"; this is injected
  into the `EventManager` instance, and then pushed into every new
  `EventManager` instance created.
- **ModuleManager** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the
  `ServiceManager`, by the service name "ModuleManager".
- **Request** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the `ServiceManager`,
  by the service name "Request".
- **Response** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the `ServiceManager`,
  by the service name "Response".

These may be satisfied at instantiation:

```php
use Laminas\EventManager\EventManager;
use Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventManager;
use Laminas\Http\PhpEnvironment;
use Laminas\ModuleManager\ModuleManager;
use Laminas\Mvc\Application;
use Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;

$config = include 'config/application.config.php';

$serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
$serviceManager->setService('SharedEventManager', new SharedEventManager());
$serviceManager->setService('ModuleManager', new ModuleManager($config));
$serviceManager->setService('Request', new PhpEnvironment\Request());
$serviceManager->setService('Response', new PhpEnvironment\Response());
$serviceManager->setFactory('EventManager', function ($serviceManager) {
    return new EventManager($serviceManager->get('SharedEventManager'));
});
$serviceManager->setShared('EventManager', false);

$application = new Application($config, $serviceManager);
```

Once you've done this, there are two additional actions you can take. The first is to "bootstrap"
the application. In the default implementation, this does the following:

- Attaches the default route listener (`Laminas\Mvc\RouteListener`).
- Attaches the default dispatch listener (`Laminas\Mvc\DispatchListener`).
- Attaches the `ViewManager` listener (`Laminas\Mvc\View\ViewManager`).
- Creates the `MvcEvent`, and injects it with the application, request, and
  response; it also retrieves the router (`Laminas\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack`)
  at this time and attaches it to the event.
- Triggers the "bootstrap" event.

If you do not want these actions, or want to provide alternatives, you can do so by extending the
`Application` class and/or manually coding what actions you want to occur.

The second action you can take with the configured `Application` is to `run()`
it. Calling this method performs the following:

- it triggers the "route" event,
- followed by the "dispatch" event, and, depending on execution,
- the "render" event

When done, it triggers the "finish" event, and then returns the response
instance. If an error occurs during either the "route" or "dispatch" event, a
"dispatch.error" event is triggered as well.

This is a lot to remember in order to bootstrap the application; in fact, we haven't covered all the
services available by default yet. You can greatly simplify things by using the default
`ServiceManager` configuration shipped with the MVC.

```php
use Laminas\Loader\AutoloaderFactory;
use Laminas\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig;
use Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;

// setup autoloader
AutoloaderFactory::factory();

// get application stack configuration
$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';

// setup service manager
$serviceManager = new ServiceManager(new ServiceManagerConfig());
$serviceManager->setService('ApplicationConfig', $configuration);

// load modules -- which will provide services, configuration, and more
$serviceManager->get('ModuleManager')->loadModules();

// bootstrap and run application
$application = $serviceManager->get('Application');
$application->bootstrap();
$application->run();
```

You can make this even simpler by using the `init()` method of the
`Application`. This is a static method for quick and easy initialization of the
`Application` instance.

```php
use Laminas\Loader\AutoloaderFactory;
use Laminas\Mvc\Application;
use Laminas\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig;
use Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;

// setup autoloader
AutoloaderFactory::factory();

// get application stack configuration
$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';

// The init() method does something very similar with the previous example.
Application::init($configuration)->run();
```

The `init()` does the following:

- Grabs the application configuration and pulls from the `service_manager` key,
  creating a `ServiceManager` instance with it and with the default services
  shipped with laminas-mvc;
- Creates a service named `ApplicationConfig` with the application configuration array;
- Grabs the `ModuleManager` service and loads the modules;
- `bootstrap()`s the `Application` and returns its instance.

> ### ApplicationConfig service
>
> If you use the `init()` method, you cannot specify a service with the name of
> 'ApplicationConfig' in your service manager config. This name is reserved to
> hold the array from `application.config.php`.  The following services can only
> be overridden from `application.config.php`:
>
> - `ModuleManager`
> - `SharedEventManager`
> - `EventManager` and `Laminas\EventManager\EventManagerInterface`
>
> All other services are configured after module loading, thus can be overridden
> by modules.

You'll note that you have a great amount of control over the workflow. Using the
`ServiceManager`, you have fine-grained control over what services are
available, how they are instantiated, and what dependencies are injected into
them. Using the `EventManager`'s priority system, you can intercept any of the
application events ("bootstrap", "route", "dispatch", "dispatch.error",
"render", and "finish") anywhere during execution, allowing you to craft your
own application workflows as needed.

## Bootstrapping a Modular Application

While the previous approach largely works, where does the configuration come
from? When we create a modular application, the assumption will be that it's
from the modules themselves. How do we get that information and aggregate it,
then?

The answer is via laminas-modulemanager. This component allows you to specify what
modules the application will use; it then locates each module and initializes
it. Module classes can tie into various listeners in order to provide
configuration, services, listeners, and more to the application. Sounds
complicated? It's not.

### Configuring the Module Manager

The first step is configuring the module manager. Inform the module manager
which modules to load, and potentially provide configuration for the module
listeners.

Remember the `application.config.php` from earlier? We're going to provide some
configuration.

```php
// config/application.config.php
return [
    'modules' => [
        /* ... */
    ],
    'module_listener_options' => [
        'module_paths' => [
            './module',
            './vendor',
        ],
    ],
];
```

As we add modules to the system, we'll add items to the `modules` array.

Each `Module` class that has configuration it wants the `Application` to know
about should define a `getConfig()` method. That method should return an array
or `Traversable` object such as a `Laminas\Config\Config` instance. As an example:

```php
namespace LaminasUser;

class Module
{
    public function getConfig() : array
    {
        return include __DIR__ . '/config/module.config.php'
    }
}
```

There are a number of other methods you can define for tasks ranging from
providing autoloader configuration, to providing services to the
`ServiceManager`, to listening to the bootstrap event.  The
[ModuleManager documentation](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-modulemanager/)
goes into more detail on these.

## Conclusion

laminas-mvc is incredibly flexible, offering an opt-in, easy to create modular
infrastructure, as well as the ability to craft your own application workflows
via the `ServiceManager` and `EventManager`. The `ModuleManager` is a
lightweight and simple approach to enforcing a modular architecture that
encourages clean separation of concerns and code re-use.
