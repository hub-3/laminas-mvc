# The MvcEvent

laminas-mvc defines and utilizes a custom `Laminas\EventManager\Event` implementation,
`Laminas\Mvc\MvcEvent`. This event is created during `Laminas\Mvc\Application::bootstrap()`
and is passed when triggering all application events.  Additionally, if your
controllers implement the `Laminas\Mvc\InjectApplicationEventInterface`, `MvcEvent`
will be injected into those controllers.

The `MvcEvent` adds accessors and mutators for the following:

- `Application` object.
- `Request` object.
- `Response` object.
- `Router` object.
- `RouteMatch` object.
- Result - usually the result of dispatching a controller.
- `ViewModel` object, typically representing the layout view model.

The methods it defines are:

- `setApplication($application)`
- `getApplication()`
- `setRequest($request)`
- `getRequest()`
- `setResponse($response)`
- `getResponse()`
- `setRouter($router)`
- `getRouter()`
- `setRouteMatch($routeMatch)`
- `getRouteMatch()`
- `setResult($result)`
- `getResult()`
- `setViewModel($viewModel)`
- `getViewModel()`
- `isError()`
- `setError()`
- `getError()`
- `getController()`
- `setController($name)`
- `getControllerClass()`
- `setControllerClass($class)`

The `Application`, `Request`, `Response`, `Router`, and `ViewModel` are all
injected during the `bootstrap` event. Following the `route` event, it will be
injected also with the `RouteMatch` object encapsulating the results of routing.

Since this object is passed around throughout the MVC, it is a common location
for retrieving the results of routing, the router, and the request and response
objects. Additionally, we encourage setting the results of execution in the
event, to allow event listeners to introspect them and utilize them within their
execution. As an example, the results could be passed into a view renderer.

## Order of events

The following events are triggered, in the following order:

Name             | Constant                         | Description
-----------------|----------------------------------|------------
`bootstrap`      | `MvcEvent::EVENT_BOOTSTRAP`      | Bootstrap the application by creating the ViewManager.
`route`          | `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE`          | Perform routing (or route-related actions).
`dispatch`       | `MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH`       | Dispatch the matched route to a controller/action.
`dispatch.error` | `MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH_ERROR` | Event triggered in case of a problem during dispatch process (e.g., unknown controller).
`render`         | `MvcEvent::EVENT_RENDER`         | Prepare the data and delegate the rendering to the view layer.
`render.error`   | `MvcEvent::EVENT_RENDER_ERROR`   | Event triggered in case of a problem during the render process (e.g., no renderer found).
`finish`         | `MvcEvent::EVENT_FINISH`         | Perform tasks once everything else is done.
